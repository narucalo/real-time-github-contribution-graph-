1. API Request Handling
•	Receiving Requests:
o	The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints (e.g., /api/contributions) to handle incoming HTTP requests from the frontend.
o	When a request is received, the backend extracts parameters such as the GitHub username, the time range for contributions, and the types of contributions to fetch.
•	Middleware:
o	The backend uses middleware like cors to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and express.json() to parse incoming JSON requests.
o	Authentication middleware may also be used to secure certain endpoints if needed.
2. Caching with Redis
•	Cache Check:
o	Before querying the GitHub API, the backend checks if the requested data is already cached in Redis.
o	If the data is found in the cache, it is retrieved and sent directly back to the client, bypassing the need for an API call.
•	Cache Miss Handling:
o	If the data is not found in the cache (a cache miss), the backend proceeds to fetch the data from the GitHub API.
o	After fetching and processing the data, it is stored in Redis with an expiration time for future requests.
3. Fetching Data from GitHub API
•	API Integration:
o	The backend uses axios or similar HTTP clients to send requests to the GitHub REST or GraphQL API.
o	The API token (stored in environment variables) is included in the request headers to authenticate the requests.
•	Rate Limiting:
o	The backend handles API rate limits by tracking the number of requests made and pausing or delaying further requests if the limit is approached.
o	Rate limit information returned by the GitHub API is logged and monitored.
4. Data Processing
•	Data Parsing:
o	The backend parses the response from the GitHub API, extracting relevant information such as commits, pull requests, issues, and code reviews.
o	The raw data is processed into a structured format that is easier for the frontend to consume, typically aggregated by date.
•	Data Aggregation:
o	Contributions are aggregated by date to form a daily summary. For example, all commits on a particular day are summed up, and the count is associated with that date.
•	Error Handling:
o	The backend handles errors such as API request failures, rate limiting issues, and data parsing errors.
o	When an error occurs, it is logged, and an appropriate HTTP error response is returned to the client (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
5. Returning Data to Frontend
•	Sending the Response:
o	After processing the data, the backend sends it back to the frontend in a JSON format.
o	The response typically includes the aggregated contribution data, including details like the number of contributions per day and the types of contributions (commits, pull requests, etc.).
•	Real-Time Updates with WebSockets:
o	The backend sets up a WebSocket server using socket.io to push real-time updates to the frontend.
o	When new contributions are detected (either by polling the GitHub API or using GitHub webhooks), the backend sends the updated data to all connected clients.
6. Real-Time Data Handling
•	Polling GitHub API:
o	The backend may periodically poll the GitHub API to check for new contributions.
o	This polling interval is configured based on the expected update frequency and API rate limits.
•	WebSocket Communication:
o	Upon detecting new contributions, the backend sends the updated data to the frontend via WebSocket.
o	The frontend then updates the visualization in real-time without requiring a full page refresh.
7. Data Storage (Optional)
•	Persistent Storage:
o	If needed, the backend can store contribution data in a database like MongoDB for historical analysis or long-term storage.
o	This data can be used for generating reports, tracking long-term trends, or providing additional insights to the user.
8. Logging and Monitoring
•	Application Logs:
o	The backend logs important events, such as incoming requests, cache hits/misses, API requests, errors, and real-time updates.
o	Logs are stored in a log management system or simply output to the console for monitoring.
•	Performance Monitoring:
o	The backend tracks performance metrics such as response times, request rates, and error rates.
o	Monitoring tools can be integrated to provide alerts if the application encounters issues like high latency, API rate limits, or server errors.
9. Security Considerations
•	Environment Variables:
o	Sensitive information such as API tokens and database connection strings are stored in environment variables and not hardcoded into the application.
o	These variables are loaded at runtime using dotenv.
•	Input Validation:
o	All incoming requests are validated to ensure that they contain the required parameters and that the parameters are in the correct format.
o	This helps prevent issues like malformed requests or injection attacks.
•	Access Control:
o	If the backend exposes any sensitive or administrative endpoints, access control measures are put in place to restrict unauthorized access.
10. Deployment and Scaling
•	Containerization with Docker:
o	The backend is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.
o	A Dockerfile is used to define the environment, and docker-compose manages multi-container deployments, including Redis and MongoDB.
•	Horizontal Scaling:
o	The backend is designed to scale horizontally, with multiple instances of the backend handling incoming requests.
o	Load balancing is employed to distribute traffic across backend instances.
